# Labyrinth Research Paper
### Date: May 2019

This is a paper I wrote about random walks on deterministic environments in my sophomore year of high school. I worked on it through an academic mentorship program with Professor Guillermo Goldsztein from Georgia Tech.

Attached is the code file that I used in the paper to simulate these random walks.
